# Why diaspora sociolinguistics?

1. A clearer, more controlled way to study language and globalization (Tseng & Hinrichs 2021)

--

1. To better model variation and diversity in the city

--

1. To improve our description of multicultural urban vernacular formation

# The community

## The Toronto Jamaican Community

.pull-left[3-4% of city's population

Immigration history

Jamaica is a diverse, majority-Black population. By iconization and erasure (Irvine & Gal 2009), community members are therefore, within Toronto, equated with Blackness.]

--

.pull-right[There are other African-descended ethnicities in Toronto (African American, African, Caribbean, South American...)...

...and there are Jamaicans who are not Black, yet...

"Black Canadian" is equated to "Jamaican"]

class: middle

Blommaert has shown us that there are ways in which Labovian sociolinguistics fails to capture sociolinguistic phenomena of the present day. 

--

Blommaert's operative term is **super-diversity**. 

There are problems with that term: it is in itself a method of erasure for the diversities that have always existed, even before the present times of accelerating diversification (Hinrichs 2015; Pavlenko 2018).

# Fieldwork and data

.pull-left[

## Fieldwork

- fieldwork in Toronto in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2011, 2014

- initial challenges of fieldwork

- JCA and Louise Bennett Memorial

- sociolinguistic interviews


]

.pull-right[

## Data

- focus on G2 and G2+n speakers with at least 1 J'can parent

- transcription of 48 interviews

- CA transcripts of selected passages > stylistic analysis

- forced alignment using DARLA > sociophonetic analysis

# Linguistic features

# Benchmark: MLE

- Parallel to Toronto

--

- Windrush generation, starting late 40s

- cp. Canadian Jamaicans, starting late 60s

--

- "emerging" (Toronto) vs. "mature" (London) diaspora communities

---
The formation of these dialects is the most interesting thing happening in big cities in Europe and North America right now 

And not only do they raise questions for sociolinguistics...

...they are also surprisingly hard to capture with established models of language contact 

---

# What type of variety formation by contact to multiethnolects represent?

- pidgin

- creole

- koine


---

# Multiethnolectalization in Toronto?

There is very little research on the emerging multiethnolect in Toronto - Farquharson, Denis, Hinrichs

---

# The issue

1. Multiethnolects are none of these! 

1. Those who have researched MLE stay away from calling it anything but MLE

# Conclusions

The study of language in the Toronto Jamaican community allows us to find public as well as private speech events that are able to reveal the **ideological embedding** of an immigrant variety;

it also reveals in stark detail the **systematicity** of a new kind of local - at the same time as translocal - indexicality in linguistic variation vis-a-vis which Labovian sociolinguistics is powerless, but which is nonetheless best sserved by study via sophisticated variationist statistical methods.
